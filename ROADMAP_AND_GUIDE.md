# Roadmap and Usage Guide

Welcome to the **Data Structures and Algorithms in C++** repository! This guide will help you navigate the content, understand the requirements, and maximize your learning.

## 🚀 How to "Make Profit" from this Repo (How to Learn)

To truly master Competitive Programming (CP) and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), you need a structured approach. Don't just read the code—implement it!

### The Golden Rule: Active Recall & Implementation
1.  **Read the Explanation**: Open the source file (e.g., `Algorithms/binary_search.cpp`). Read the comments at the top and the code logic.
2.  **Understand, Don't Memorize**: Try to dry-run the code with a small example on paper.
3.  **Implement from Scratch**: Close the file and try to write the algorithm yourself in a blank file.
4.  **Verify**: Compile and run your code. Compare it with the repo's code only if you get stuck.

### 🗺️ Learning Roadmap

Follow this path to build a strong foundation.

#### Phase 1: The Essentials
*   **Basics**: Master the template, understand Time Complexity ($O(N)$ vs $O(N^2)$), and get comfortable with Fast I/O.
*   **Data Structures (Part 1)**: `Vectors`, `Stacks`, `Queues`. You cannot code without these.
*   **Algorithms (Part 1)**: `Sorting` and `Two Pointers`. These solve 50% of easy problems.

#### Phase 2: The Core
*   **Data Structures (Part 2)**: `Maps` and `Sets` (STL is your best friend).
*   **Algorithms (Part 2)**: `Binary Search`. This is a superpower. Learn to identify when to use it (monotonic functions).
*   **Math**: `GCD`, `LCM`, `Primes`. CP is 30% math.

#### Phase 3: Advanced Concepts
*   **Graph Theory**: `BFS` and `DFS`. The gateway to advanced problems.
*   **Dynamic Programming**: `Knapsack`, `LCS`. The hardest part for beginners. Don't give up!
*   **Strings**: `KMP`, `Trie`. Essential for text processing problems.

#### Phase 4: Mastery (The "Expert" Zone)
*   **Advanced DS**: `Segment Trees`, `Fenwick Trees`. For range query problems.
*   **Backtracking & Bit Manipulation**: `N-Queens`, Bitwise optimizations.

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before diving in, you should have:
1.  **Basic C++ Syntax**: know what `int`, `for loop`, `if-else`, and `functions` are.
2.  **Logical Thinking**: Enjoy solving puzzles.
3.  **Determination**: You will get stuck. That is part of the process.
