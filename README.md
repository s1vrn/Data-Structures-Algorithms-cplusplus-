# Competitive Programming Guide for Beginners

Welcome to your Competitive Programming (CP) learning journey! This repository is designed to help you understand the core concepts, data structures, and algorithms used in CP, implemented in C++.

## Roadmap

We recommend going through the folders in the following order:

1.  **01_Basics**:
    *   Learn the standard CP template to save time in contests.
    *   Understand Fast I/O to handle large input/output efficiently.
    *   Grasp Time Complexity (Big O) to predict if your code will pass.

2.  **02_DataStructures**:
    *   `std::vector` (Dynamic arrays)
    *   `std::set` and `std::map` (Balanced BSTs)
    *   Stacks and Queues

3.  **03_Algorithms**:
    *   Sorting (Custom comparators)
    *   Binary Search
    *   Two Pointers Technique
    *   Greedy Algorithms
    *   Merge Sort & Quick Sort

4.  **04_Math**:
    *   Number Theory basics (GCD, LCM)
    *   Sieve of Eratosthenes (Prime generation)

5.  **05_GraphTheory**:
    *   Graph Representations (Adjacency Matrix vs List)
    *   BFS (Breadth-First Search)
    *   DFS (Depth-First Search)

6.  **06_DynamicProgramming**:
    *   Knapsack (0/1)
    *   Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
    *   Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
    *   Coin Change

7.  **07_Strings**:
    *   KMP Algorithm (Pattern Matching)
    *   Rabin-Karp (Rolling Hash)
    *   Trie (Prefix Tree)

8.  **08_Backtracking**:
    *   N-Queens Problem
    *   Sudoku Solver
    *   Permutations

9.  **09_BitManipulation**:
    *   Bitwise Tricks and Optimizations
    *   Subset Generation using Bitmasks

10. **Advanced Data Structures (in 02_DataStructures)**:
    *   Segment Tree
    *   Fenwick Tree (BIT)
    *   Disjoint Set Union (DSU)

## How to Run the Code

To compile and run any C++ file in this repository:

1.  Open your terminal.
2.  Navigate to the file's directory.
3.  Compile using `g++`:
    ```bash
    g++ -std=c++17 <filename>.cpp -o <output_name>
    ```
4.  Run the executable:
    ```bash
    ./<output_name>
    ```

**Example:**
```bash
cd 01_Basics
g++ -std=c++17 template.cpp -o template
./template
```

Happy Coding!
